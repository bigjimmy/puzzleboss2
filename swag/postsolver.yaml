summary: Update multiple solver parts
description: |
  Update multiple solver properties in a single API call. This is more efficient
  than making separate calls for each property.
  
  Pass a JSON object where keys are the part names and values are the new values.
  
  Special handling for 'puzz' field:
  - Setting 'puzz' to a puzzle ID assigns the solver to that puzzle
  - Setting 'puzz' to empty/null unassigns the solver from their current puzzle
  - Puzzle assignment automatically logs activity and may change puzzle status
  
  Optional 'source' field can be provided for activity logging (default: 'puzzleboss').
